## Portfolio site

I have probably redisigned this site more times than I can count. After numerous trashed designs in Figma and numerous hours spent coding only to trash it, I finally settled for a simple html and css site.

You can view the figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/X4MFOWYkOzLIP3xW53z88l/Porfolio-FInal?node-id=1%3A12&t=uokBcjxSyZvQyQgi-1) (The Vs Code window is **not** a screenshot, yep, that took long)

### Stuff

- I used bootstrap wrappers and breakpoints for responsivity.
- The form is sent to [FormBackend](https://www.formbackend.com/) and spam and bot filtering is done there. (A captcha form messed up the aesthetic tbh. I am not that lazy :)
